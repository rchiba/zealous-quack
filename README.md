TODO: Get normative case of 2 users connecting, and photobooths working. I'm at the point where the first photobooth is saving correctly, relationships are being created correctly. But the permissions on the other user's photobooth are preventing the second one from being created. Just have to figure out the right rule and the right place to put the partner_uid so that the rule can get access to it

Normative case of 2 users connecting and photobooths working. Now working on love button concept. Normative love button case working. I feel like it can be polished more, namely, adding color, making the final animation more satisfying (ex: heart growing smaller as particle effect happens, the total score incrementing, having the rate of hearts coming out change over time)

Next ideas: clock, weather, countdowns, slot machine and things you can win with the points (persistent stickers)
